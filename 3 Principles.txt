👁️ use TOR browser as your initial browser 

👁️ apply these to only one computer and never connect any other device to the router it uses; turn router wifi off

👁️ use open source chromium-based browsers (e.g. UnGoogled Chromium, Brave)
- ungoogled chromium browser:
https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/
- brave browser:
https://brave.com/

👁️ disable third-party cookies from browser settings (preferably all cookies)

👁️ change router, operating system and browser's preferred DNS server to something safer (e.g. OpenDNS, Cloudflare, Quad9, … )

👁️ purchase a well-known VPN service (e.g. ProtonVPN plus) on a separate instance and not with your credit card; only connect and use it through an open-source VPN manager (e.g. OpenVPN)
- connecting to protonvpn servers through openvpn:
https://protonvpn.com/support/openvpn-windows-setup/

👁️ do not login to browser account itself

👁️ create any and every account on a separate instance

👁️ create a unique email for every account on a separate instance (e.g. one for steam, one for discord, …)

👁️ never log into an account when a trail of activity exists; 
only log into accounts on a separate instance.

👁️ compartmentalize activities to as many separate instances as possible

👁️ perform general activity or any activity that doesn’t require a logged-in account on a separate instance with no logged-in account
👁️ perform interactions between two accounts on a separate instance with no activity trail


👁️ do not use browser’s password storage & autofill features

👁️ apply the following browser settings or their rough equivalent, if present:
- disable third party cookies
- disable all “protection”
- disable all suggestions 
- disable all personalization
- disable “continue to run in background”
- enable “send do-not-track requests”  
- disable “allow websites to check if you have saved payment methods”
- disable “send diagnostic data” anything
- disable “help improve” anything
- disable “Allow recently closed sites to finish sending and receiving data”
- delete all preset search engines and create a duckduckgo manually (https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s)

👁️ avoid linking or connecting accounts together on any application or website

👁️ never connect phone to computer directly via USB, whether it’s to transfer files or charge

👁️ never use cloud folder applications (e.g. MEGA, dropbox, …)

👁️ when creating accounts, avoid providing real name, real location, real family ties or other personal information;
make sure the accounts’ name, username, Bio, birth date & … cannot be correlated to pinpoint you. fill in personal data with random things. avoid sending friend requests. 
👁️ do not add your accounts or emails to any device other than the chosen computer;
you must absolutely avoid associating your safe computer with any other device you own

👁️ never “verify” on any other device; use browser addon instead of phone authenticator or even virtualize android for that purpose.
In case verification is needed, either copy the link to the primer session or verify in a different instance.

⛭ to create a password:

1- select a word with at least eight letters, which you’d always remember; this word will be used for all your passwords
e.g. password, combination, authentication, identification or distinction

2- capitalize at least one letter; the chosen letters will be capitalized for all your passwords
e.g. pasSword, CombiNation, authENtication, identifiCATion or DisTincTion

3- add at least one special character in-between letters; the chosen special character and its place will be the same for all your passwords
e.g. pas-Sword, Combi~Nation~, auth^EN^tication, i_denti_fi_CATi_on or .DisTincTion.

4- add at least two number digits anywhere; the chosen digits and their place will remain the same for all your passwords
e.g. pas66-Sword, Combi6~Na8tion~, 00auth^7EN^tication, i_den98ti_fi_CA8Ti_on or .Dis6Tinc6Tion6.

5- add at least 1 more character of any kind for core accounts; (e.g. google, microsoft, steam, …)

6- add the target application or website’s initials somewhere in the password;
e.g. @ pornhub: PHpas66-Sword, Combi6~PhNa8tion~, 00auth^7EN^pHtication, phi_den98ti_fi_CA8Ti_on or .pHDis6Tinc6Tion6.
e.g. @ reddit: Rpas66-Sword, Combi6~RNa8tion~, 00auth^7EN^rtication, ri_den98ti_fi_CA8Ti_on or .rDis6Tinc6Tion6.


👁️ never digitally or even physically save your passwords; use your brain

👁️ never trust browser-based applications (e.g. discord, coinomi)

👁️ if an application can be ran through browser, run it through browser on a separate instance.
avoid installing applications as much as possible. especially on windows.

👁️ use burner, virtual or temporary phone numbers to get past the initial verification of account creations 

👁️ on core accounts (e.g. Google), manually disable all data collection and opt out of all personalization 

👁️ for online activities that legally require you to represent your true identity, (e.g. any online exam, any bank transaction, any online purchase, any legal paperwork) use another device on a different internet service provider without any precautions. (e.g. phone with simcard internet)

⛭ to use cryptocurrencies:
1-use non-custodial open-source wallets or a non-custodial open-source multiwallet
2-create two wallets for each cryptocurrency 
3-Differentiate the two sets through different names; 
Name the second set differently from the first set
E.g. BNBX, BNBY, LTCX, LTCY, NANOX, NANOY
4-Crypto from the first set must never be sent to the second set; 
Crypto from the second set must never be sent to the first set
5-When you buy crypto through any method, have it sent to one of your first set wallets
6-Exchange the purchased crypto from the first set for another crypto and have it sent to a second set wallet
If your wallet does not feature an exchange service, use binance, also with two sets of wallet
in other words, compartmentalize and launder your crypto
When spending crypto to purchase things with your real identity, use wallets of the first set,
when spending crypto to purchase things anonymously, use wallets of the second set.
